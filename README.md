PARTY3
======

Make sure you know what third-party services are up to.

Usage
-----

Add some services to `party3/services.py`. Have fun.

Deploying
---------

This project is designed, in a fit of utter irony, to be deployed to Heroku.
There's no web role, so to keep it in the free tier, just spin up a scheduler
(but only one) and add workers if you need to.
